[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
API for the [Dart](https://dartlang.org)
programming language.

The goal of this project is to provide first-class support for machine learning
and data science in Dart, a strongly-typed language that runs
across all platforms.

This project is still in its early stages, but will grow very quickly.

## Installation
This library uses native bindings, which (currently) are not easily
distributed using Dart's Pub package manager.

Building the bindings, however, is easy and quick, as the build uses pre-built
Tensorflow binaries, rather than re-building per user.

## Prerequisites
You'll need the following installed to run Tensorflow for Dart:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [Dart SDK >=2.0.0-dev](https://www.dartlang.org/install)

It's also strongly recommended to install the
[`scripts`](https://github.com/thosakwe/dart_scripts) command-line utility for Dart,
which allows you to build the bindings in one step:

```bash
$ pub global activate scripts
```

Ensure that you have the path to Pub's global executables in your `PATH` environment variable.

On Windows, this is `%APPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin`, whereas on UNIX-based systems, it should be
`~/.pub-cache/bin`.

## Building as a Dependency
If you are using `package:tensorflow` as a dependency in a Dart project, then you will
need to build the native bindings. This process is made simple the `tool/build.dart` file
included with this project.

Using the `scripts` tool, you can build the bindings in your Pub cache, and they will be
available to all Dart projects on your system:

```bash
$ scripts get && scripts clean
```

As an added bonus, the files generated by CMake are cached, which means you likely only
ever have to build them once.

## Building by Itself
If you are contributing to the project, you will certainly need to be able to
build the project on the fly. Use the provided `tool/build.dart` script to build
the project on-the-fly.
